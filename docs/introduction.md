# E-Fish tracking

is a package for easier handling of tracking data. The package wraps some reader for data files created with [DeeplabCut](https://deeplabcut.org/) or [SLEAP](https://deeplabcut.org/). 
So far the readers can read the [hdf5](https://hdfgroup.org/) (``*.h5``) files written by DLC and the [NIX](https://github.com/g-node/nix) data files that can be exported from SLEAP.
